* Tokens are seperated by whitespace
* '(' and ')' are whitespace
* Tokens that are all non-alphanumeric or start with a ':' are messages
* Tokens in double quotes are strings.
* Tokens in single quotes are symbols.
* Tokens in /.*/ are regular expressions.
* Tokens that are numbers are numbers

When a message is encountered:
* The top two items are popped
* The next-to-top item is passed the message with the argument being the top
